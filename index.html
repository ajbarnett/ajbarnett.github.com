							<h2>Out of Towners</h2>

							<p class="margin-bottom:50px;">Boulder sits at the edge of the Rocky Mountains, about thirty miles from Denver and one mile above sea-level. If you are coming from lower elevations, remember to drink a lot of water. Here are some fun places to visit while you are in town. </p>

							<div class="block cf">
								<img class="fllimg" width="300" src="img/pearl_st_mall.png">
								<h4>Pearl Street</h4>

								<p>For those coming from the east, Pearl St. is similar to Faneuil Hall in Boston. You can shop, eat and check out some of the street performers. This <a href="http://www.boulderdowntown.com/" target="_blank">Downtown Boulder website</a> has more information on what stores, restaurants and events you can discover. Also, if you are looking to hit some bars after the sun has gone down, this is where you'll want to be.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="block cf">
								<img class="flrimg" width="300" src="img/Dushanbe.png">
								<h4 class="txtr">Dushambe Tea House</h4>

								<p class="txtr">Not far from Pearl St. sits the <a href="http://www.boulderteahouse.com/" target="_blank">Dushanbe Tea House</a>, a gift from Boulder's sister city, Dushanbe, Tajikistan. The building sits along side Boulder Creek in Central Park and is certainly worth visiting. In addition to several varieties of tea, you can also find some delicious food.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="block cf">
								<img class="fllimg" width="300" src="img/farmersmarket.png">
								<h4>Farmer's Market</h4>

								<p>Also in Central Park is the site of the <a href="http://www.boulderfarmers.org/" target="_blank">Boulder Farmer's Market</a>. It runs every Wednesday (4 pm - 8 pm) and Saturday (8 am - 2 pm). Sample foods and more from local vendors. There is always live music and kids can get their faces painted. We highly recommend the eggs benedict from the Happy Orange Tent and the dumplings from Sister's Pantry. </p>
							</div>

							<div class="block cf">
								<img class="flrimg" width="300" src="img/red_rocks_trail.png">
								<h4 class="txtr">Hiking</h4>

								<p class="txtr">Boulder sits right at the edge of the Rocky Mountains with easy access to hiking. <a href="http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3058&Itemid=1037" target="_blank">This website</a> has information on tons of trails. A couple favorites of ours are Red Rocks Trail (see picture to right), which is short and easy, and Saddle Rock, which is hard work, but has great views.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="block cf">
								<img class="fllimg" width="300" src="img/creek_tubing.png">
								<h4>Boulder Creek</h4>

								<p>Boulder Creek flows through the city and is great to visit in the summer. A bike path runs alongside where you can walk, jog, and, of course, bike. As you follow the creek West, towards the mountains, you will come to Eben G. Fine Park, which is where we will have a <a href="#fridaypicnic">picnic</a> on the Friday before the wedding. This section of the creek is a popular spot for tubing. </p>
							</div>

							<div class="block cf">
								<img class="flrimg" width="300" src="img/rmnp.png">
								<h4 class="txtr">Rocky Mountain National Park</h4>

								<p class="txtr">This tiny picture won't do the park justice, and neither will <a href="http://rockymountainnationalpark.com/explore/photo-gallery" target="_blank">these larger ones</a>, but a visit to the park in June will certainly grab your attention. Explore scenery and wildlife by hiking or just driving through. The park's entrance is within only an hour's drive from Boulder.</p>

							<p>Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered.  The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.  </p>
							<img class="flrimg" width="300" src="img/37.png">
							<p>At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him.  When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart.  It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert.  Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well.  She smiled, and that was certainly an omen- the omen he had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life.  The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.</p> 
							<p>It was the pure Language of the World.  It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.  What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing.  He was more certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed.  But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city.  And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant.  There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world.  Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning. </p>
